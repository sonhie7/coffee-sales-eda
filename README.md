# Coffee Sales — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes coffee sales data using Excel to explore revenue trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

## Tools & Techniques Used
- **Excel**: for data cleaning, analysis, and reporting
- **Functions**: 
  - `VLOOKUP` and `INDEX + MATCH` for merging tables and retrieving data
  - Pivot tables for summarizing sales
- **Data Cleaning**: handling missing values and ensuring consistent formats
- **Visualization**: charts and tables to highlight trends and insights

## Problem Statement
Coffee stores and distributors generate daily sales data, but without analysis, it’s impossible to know:
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- Which customers purchase the most?
- Which months or days have the highest sales?
- Is revenue increasing or decreasing over time?
- Which type of coffee is the most profitable?

This project answers those questions through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

##  Data Cleaning Steps
- Removed duplicates
- Standardized product names
- Calculated Total Sales = Qty × Unit Price
- Cleaned customer names and e-mails

##  Analysis
- Sales by coffee type
- Monthly revenue trend
- Top 5 customers
- Best-selling products
- Seasonal analysis

##  Insights
- The coffee type Excelsa generates the highest revenue.
- Peak sales in March & July.
- Top customers = majority of revenue.
- Light coffee is the most profitable product.

## Conclusion
This analysis identifies top-performing products, peak sales periods, and key customers. 
Next steps could include :
- Targeted promotions for high-value customers.
- Giving coupons to loyal customers.
- Optimizing inventory for best-selling products.
